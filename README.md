# EatDaBurger
UNIT #13: Node Express Handlebars

## Fire Up Application in CLI
 ```sh
$ node server.js
```
## Usage
In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM . Use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they want.


Whenever a user submits the burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.


Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.


Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
